<h2>Fill me in on the concept of "stars and dogs" by boston consulting group</h2>
<p>"Stars and Dogs" is a concept developed by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to describe the different types of business units within a company. The concept is based on the BCG growth-share matrix, which plots a company's business units on a grid with market growth rate on the x-axis and relative market share on the y-axis.</p>
<p>According to the matrix, there are four types of business units:</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong>: These are business units with high market share in a high-growth market. They require significant investment to maintain their position.</p>
<p><strong>Cash Cows</strong>: These are business units with high market share in a low-growth market. They generate a lot of cash, which can be used to invest in other business units.</p>
<p><strong>Question Marks</strong>: These are business units with low market share in a high-growth market. They have the potential to become stars, but also have a high risk of becoming dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Dogs</strong>: These are business units with low market share in a low-growth market. They do not generate much cash and may be candidates for divestment.</p>
<p>The BCG Growth-Share Matrix is a tool to evaluate and categorize the company's product and business portfolio based on market growth and relative market share. It helps to identify the business unit and products that require different strategic actions.</p>

<h2>Has this matrix been applied to fields other than products and markets?</h2>
<p>The BCG Growth-Share Matrix was originally developed to help companies evaluate and manage their product portfolios. However, the matrix can also be adapted to other areas, such as business units, subsidiaries, or even individual projects within a company. It can also be used to evaluate a company's customer base, for example by plotting customers based on their lifetime value and growth potential.</p>
<p>The matrix has been applied to fields other than product and market portfolios as well. It has been used in the field of Human Resources, for example, to evaluate the potential and performance of employees.</p>
<p>How could one apply it to different sections or articles on a website?</p>
<p>The BCG Growth-Share Matrix can be adapted to evaluate different sections or articles on a website in the following way:</p>
<p><span class="kpi">Market growth rate</span> can be represented by the <span class="kpi">traffic growth rate</span> of the section or article, with high traffic growth indicating a high-growth market.</p>
<p><span class="kpi">Relative market share</span> can be represented by the <span class="kpi">traffic share of the section or article</span>, with high traffic share indicating a high relative market share.</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong>: sections or articles with high traffic growth and high traffic share that are performing well and generating revenue, would require significant investment to maintain their position.</p>
<p><strong>Cash Cows</strong>: sections or articles with low traffic growth but high traffic share that are generating revenue, would be considered low-risk and could be used to fund other sections or articles.</p>
<p><strong>Question Marks</strong>: sections or articles with high traffic growth but low traffic share that have potential to become stars, but also have a high risk of becoming dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Dogs</strong>: sections or articles with low traffic growth and low traffic share that are not generating revenue and may be candidates for revamping or removal.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this is a simplified version of the matrix, and it is important to consider other metrics, such as conversion rate, bounce rate, and revenue generated, in order to make an informed decision. Additionally, the matrix can be used as a tool to evaluate the performance and potential of different sections or articles on a website, but it should not be the only factor to consider in making decisions regarding those sections or articles.</p>

<h2>Assume we have the following dimensions and metrics: <strong>users, new users, sessions, page views, ad views, conversions, revenue, customer churn</strong>. Which ones would be suited best for such a matrix?</h2>
<p>The BCG Growth-Share Matrix can be adapted to evaluate different sections or articles on a website by plotting them based on two key dimensions: market growth rate and relative market share. When it comes to the metrics you've provided:</p>
<p><span class="kpi">Market growth rate</span> can be represented by the <span class="kpi">growth rate of new users, sessions, or page views</span>, with high growth indicating a high-growth market.</p>
<p><span class="kpi">Relative market share</span> can be represented by the <span class="kpi">share of total users, sessions, or page views that a section or article receives</span>, with high share indicating a high relative market share.</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong>: sections or articles with high growth rate in new users, sessions, or page views and high relative market share, that are generating revenue and have low customer churn, would require significant investment to maintain their position.</p>
<p><strong>Cash Cows</strong>: sections or articles with low growth rate in new users, sessions, or page views but high relative market share, that are generating revenue, and have low customer churn, would be considered low-risk and could be used to fund other sections or articles.</p>
<p><strong>Question Marks</strong>: sections or articles with high growth rate in new users, sessions, or page views but low relative market share, that have potential to become stars, but also have a high risk of becoming dogs, high customer churn.</p>
<p><strong>Dogs</strong>: sections or articles with low growth rate in new users, sessions, or page views and low relative market share, that are not generating revenue, and have high customer churn, may be candidates for revamping or removal.</p>
<p>It's important to note that revenue, conversion rates, and ad views can also be used in combination with the above metrics to evaluate the performance and potential of different sections or articles on a website. Additionally, the matrix can be used as a tool to evaluate the performance and potential of different sections or articles on a website, but it should not be the only factor to consider in making decisions regarding those sections or articles.</p>
